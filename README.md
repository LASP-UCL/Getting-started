# Quickstart your project
Congratulation on your project!   
It will be a great research journey and, as every research journey, it will start from reading!
The purpose of this document is to guide you your journey on a short-term Machine Learning project. 
It provides: a) Directions on how to start your projects, b) Skills we expect before you start c) Resources to deepen your knowledge in Deep and Reinforcement Learning, and d) Resources on how to improve your coding skills.

To start a new project, please send an email to `lasp@live.ucl.ac.uk` with subject `Student project: <your-student-ID>, <name-surname>`.
There is a list of available projects to work on at [this link]().
In the email, please speficy which project you will work on, the GitHub username you will use throughout, and the url of the repository you just created (see XXX for guidelines on how to create the repository).
Please fill this form a week in advance you intend to start your project. This allows us enough time to grant you the necessary permissions on GitHub.

### 0. Requirements
Before getting started on the project, we expect the student to:
- Have elements of linear algebra, statistics and a rough understanding of what machine learning is.
- Have a basic undertanding of the [experimental method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment) for research.
- Have a basic understanding of [linux](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview)
- Being able to write and run Python code
- Know how to compartmentalise running code, for example using [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and [conda environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

If you do not meet this criteria, please consider taking the time to engage in the study of the above, before starting your project.
The average learning time is around a full two weeks of study.
In our experience, starting your project without the elements above could make it a very hard challenge to complete it.


### 2. Organise your code in GitHub
We expect the code used to run your experiments to be hosted on GitHub. Note that this code is public.
Because this is your own personal project, we recommend hosting it on your own GitHub page. We will then [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) your repository in the https://github.com/LASP-UCL organisation.

If you are not familiar with Git or GitHub, [this](https://github.com/education/github-starter-course) preliminary introduction is a good start.

To start writing your code, create a new repository using [this](https://github.com/LASP-UCL/Your-project-title) template. [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) is how to create a new repository from a template.


### 3. Writing code
We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for its simplicity of use and its versatility with remote code execution.
We also suggest these extensions for Visual Studio Code. See [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace) for how to install extensions.
- Remote-SSH
- GitLens
- Jupyter

When writing your machine learning code, we suggest using [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html) for its trade-off between clarity and performance.


### 4. Logging your experiments
[Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/) is a great free tool to maintain a log of your experiments, and strongly suggested.
[Here](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart) is a quickstart for wandb, and [here](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/pytorch) is the bespoke guide for the Pytorch integration.
Please use wandb to communicate your results with us.





# Resources

### Literature management
There are a number of literature management software available for free, among which, we recommend:
- [`My Library` in Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?scilib=1&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5)
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)
- [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/guides/desktop/)








### High Performance Computing (HPC) at UCL
UCL offers a High Performance Computing infrastructure to run expensive computation. In machine learning project, especially in Deep Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning, it is very likely that you will need one or more GPU to run your experiments.
The Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering has a very clear guide on the [servers available](https://intranet.ee.ucl.ac.uk/it/servers/gpu) and on how to [connect to them](https://intranet.ee.ucl.ac.uk/it/remote-access/remote-access-to-linux).
When using these servers, please minimise the amout of computation, and don't occupy GPUs that you do not need.


### 6. Writing your report

# Starting your project
In this document you can find a detailed reading list. The list is categorized into three different types of readings: 
1. Scientific books/papers to build background knowledge that will be certainly needed during the project as well as to get you up-to-speed 
on the literature for your project subject
1. Practical guides and tutorial to improve your coding skills 
1. Very useful links on how to write a scientific report and dissertation



### Scientific books and papers


### Coding tutorials and guides
