# Getting started for students
The purpose of this document is to guide students to start their Machine Learning university project. 
It provides a set of tools to i) manage literature documents, ii) organise their code in GitHub, iii) write clear and reproducible code, iv) use the high performance computing infrastructure at UCL, and v) writing your report.

--- 
### Requirements
Before getting started on the project, we expect the student to:
- Have elements of linear algebra, statistics and a rough understanding of what machine learning is.
- Have a basic undertanding of the [experimental method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment) for research.
- Have a basic understanding of [linux](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview)
- Being able to write and run Python code
- Know how to compartmentalise running code, for example using [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and [conda environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).


If you do not meet this criteria, please consider taking the time to 
it could be a very hard challenge to complete your project.


### 1. Literature management
There are a number of literature management software available for free.
We recommend:
- [`My Library` in Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?scilib=1&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5)
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)
- [Mendely](https://www.mendeley.com/guides/desktop/)


### 2. Organise your code in GitHub
We expect the code 
If you are not familiar with Git or GitHub, [this](https://github.com/education/github-starter-course) preliminary introduction is a good start.

Please use this template repository when creating a new one. [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) is how to create a new repository from a template.


### 3. Writing code
Visual Studio code.
Pytorch https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html


### 4. High Performance Computing (HPC) at UCL



### 5. Writing your report

### Student project form
When starting a new project, please fill this form, and send it to `lasp@live.ucl.ac.uk` with subject `Student project: <your-student-ID>, <name-surname>`.
In the email, speficy on which project you will work on, and the GitHub username you will use throughout.
Please fill this form a week in advance you intend to start your project. This allows us enough time to grant the permissions necessary for you to start using GitHub.
